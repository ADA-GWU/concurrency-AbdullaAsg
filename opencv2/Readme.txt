-------About the project

Project is aimed to demonstrate multithreading in C++. Program
accepts image name, square size and processing mode single or multi (S/M) 
and returns averaged image as result.jpg .
OpenCV library is used for processing and displaying image.




-------How to run the prgram

To run the program one only need to run 'opencv2.exe' in the project folder.
opencv2.exe requires 'opencv_world454.dll' to operate
Then parameters should be included, for example( image1.jpg   50   M )
Images that will be used as input to the program should be stored in 'images' folder.
Output image will also be stored in 'images' folder as 'result.jpg'. 
If result is not removed after each execution, result.jpg will be replaced with
new image everytime.


-------How to compile the source code

In order to compile the code, OpenCV library should be downloaded and linked to the IDE.
OpenCV could be linked to the Visual Studio as described in the link below:
